# Discord.py BOT
My old Discord.py bot I had , I'm not sure if it works right now. so basically I coded this discord bot in 2020, this bot it what got me into python coding. I learned Discord API, YouTube API and succesfully making a working Application. I dont know if the code works, I cant install discord.py due to technical issues. 

This is my first project and I was inspired by a Discord Bot of a YouTuber called rSlash

Disclaimer: No Documentation of the bot exists because I was very new to coding
